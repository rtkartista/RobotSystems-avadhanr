## Simultaneity
### sensing, interpretation, and control run independently and in parallel
- Multitasking, in which a single processor rapidly switches between the different functions it is executing, and
    - cooperative -  the time-sharing of the processor is determined by the functions themselves
    - preemtive - threading -  the time-sharing of the processor is allocated externally by the computerâ€™s operating system
- Multiprocessing, in which the functions are assigned to dedicated processors.

### Tasks
1. Defined a class `Concurrency` in `concurrency.py` which has a variable storing a message and two methods which returns and writes messages in between threads.
2. Defined a producer, consumer-producer, or consumer functions for the sensor, interpretation and control processes from week 3 in the `Concurrency class`.
3. The three defined functions are called in a loop in the `picar_new2.py function` with a delay of 10ms.

### Media

### Installations
1. readerwriterlock Python module - `python3 -m pip install -U readerwriterlock`

### Observations
1. added `eSensor . result ()` in the `picar_new2.py` to terminate the program by hitting Ctrl+c only once
2. in the assignment, `readerwriterlock` was used to set the following three priorities
    - Only one thread is allowed to write the bus message at any given time, and may not start writing while any other thread is reading the message
    - Any number of threads may read the bus message at any given time, but may not start reading while a thread is writing the message
    - Write operations are given priority over read operations
